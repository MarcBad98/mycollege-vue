    <h1>Copyright Policy</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy ("Policy") applies to the
      <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://my-college.com">
        my-college.com
      </a>
      website ("Website" or "Service") and any of its related products and
      services (collectively, "Services") and outlines how this Website operator
      ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our") addresses copyright infringement
      notifications and how you ("you" or "your") may submit a copyright
      infringement complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we
      ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy
      to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright
      infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium
      Copyright Act ("DMCA") of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S.
      Copyright Office
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov">website</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
    <p>
      Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use
      could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of
      copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim
      for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research,
      without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder.
      If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a
      copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in
      question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting
      is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a
      notification with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your
      notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include
      sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly
      infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your
      information being forwarded, you may wish to
      <a

        href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns"
      >
        hire an agent
      </a>
      to report infringing material for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any
      material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may
      submit a written copyright infringement notification ("Notification")
      using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such
      Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/create/dmca-takedown-notice"
      >
        DMCA takedown notice generator
      </a>
      or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of
      your Notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your
      complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If
      your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include
      the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as
      well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers’ accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in
      response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good
      faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the
      removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your
      Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address),
      along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this
      Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of
      a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all
      the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.
    </p>
    <h2>Counter-notifications</h2>
    <p>
      A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a
      counter-Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US
      Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it
      means that the material described in the Notification has been removed
      from our Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please
      take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information
      on the Notification we received. To file a counter-notification with us,
      you must provide a written communication compliant with the DMCA
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you are not sure whether certain material infringes
      the copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or
      restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an
      attorney before filing a counter-notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this
      Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of
      a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies
      with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to the person who
      filed the original Notification.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the
      Website and Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated
      version of this Policy on the Website. When we do, we will revise the
      updated date at the bottom of this page. Policy was created with
